PREDICTING THE CUSTOMER CHURN RATE USING THE ANACONDA NAVIGATOR AND AND JUPITAR NOTEBOOK


For this code pattern, we used the Anaconda Navigator to open the jupitar notebook. Anaconda Navigator allows user to launch applications and manage conda packages,
environments and channels without using command-line commands. Navigator can search for packages, install them in an environment, run the packages and update them.
So this is more useful environment for the installation and launching of jupitar notebook to run the commands.
In that anaconda Navigator, we launched the jupitar notebook. Jupitar notebook is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

After knowing about these environments and collaborative tools we move onto how to run the code in this jupitar notebook :

1) First create a notbook in a jupitar app, and then put the datasets in the same directory for the access of that. If not , for the access of that we have to put the path
    of the directory in which the dataset belongs.
2) After that we have to run each cell to get the ouput of a perticular command. For that ,first we have to mention all the libraries and packages that are required for the 
   successful continuation of the code.
3) Step by step we have to do all the required methods for predicting the dataset like preprocessing , EDA, data cleaning , classification techniques and finally 
   the optimization part.
4) If required we can connect this notebook with a frontend part for the interactive visualization.
